# CMD-Tetris
tetris in command prompt/terminal, written in c

the tetrys chrome extension sucked so i made my own tetris to play in class

the make command works for mac and linux but not for windows; ncurses isnt officially ported to windows last i checked

though if you really want you could probably ssh into a linux system and play it that way
